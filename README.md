# Potato-Disease-Classification

A deep learning project for classifying potato leaf diseases using image recognition techniques. The model is trained to accurately detect and categorize *Healthy, **Early Blight, and **Late Blight* conditions in potato plants using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 Classifies potato leaves into three categories: Healthy, Early Blight, and Late Blight.
- 🧠 Trained using CNNs in TensorFlow/Keras.
- 📊 High accuracy on test data with validation.
- 🖼 Uses real image datasets of potato leaves.
- 🛠 Optionally includes data augmentation to prevent overfitting.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used is the [Potato Leaf Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease) from Kaggle, which includes:
- Potato___Healthy
- Potato___Early_blight
- Potato___Late_blight
